‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt           # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                 # This documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                     # Environment variables (create this)
```

## üì¶ Dependencies

- **agno**: Core Agno framework for AI agents
- **groq**: Groq API client for AI model access
- **duckduckgo-search**: DuckDuckGo search functionality
- **google-search-results**: Serper API for enhanced search
- **yfinance**: Yahoo Finance data retrieval
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Navigate to the finance agent directory:

```bash
cd finance_agent
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Environment Setup

The script looks for environment variables in the parent directory. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
cd .. # Go to project root
touch .env
```

Add your API keys to the `.env` file:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key_here
```

**Get your API keys**:
- **Groq API key**: Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/) for free access
- **Serper API key**: Visit [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev/) for free access

### 3. Run the Financial Analysis Team

```bash
cd finance_agent  # Back to agent directory
python3 financial_analysis_team.py
```

The team will automatically analyze AI semiconductor companies' market outlook and financial performance.

## üí° Usage Examples

### Default Analysis

The script comes pre-configured to analyze:
```
"What's the market outlook and financial performance of AI semiconductor companies?"
```

### Custom Analysis

To analyze different topics, modify the query in `financial_analysis_team.py`:

```python
agent_team.print_response("Your custom financial query here", stream=True)
```

### Example Queries

- **Market Analysis**: "What's the current state of the renewable energy market?"
- **Stock Performance**: "Analyze Tesla's financial performance over the last quarter"
- **Sector Comparison**: "Compare the performance of tech giants vs traditional banks"
- **Investment Research**: "What are the best investment opportunities in AI stocks?"
- **Economic Analysis**: "How is inflation affecting the housing market?"

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Model Configuration

All agents use the same model configuration:
- **Model**: `moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct`
- **Provider**: Groq
- **Features**: Fast inference, high-quality responses
- **API Key**: Retrieved from environment variables

### Agent Instructions

#### Web Agent Instructions:
- Always include sources
- Search for current and accurate information
- Provide comprehensive answers

#### Finance Agent Instructions:
- Use tables to display data

## üîß Customization

### Changing the Analysis Query

Modify the last line in `financial_analysis_team.py`:

```python
agent_team.print_response("Your custom query here", stream=True)
```

### Adding Custom Instructions

Modify the agent configurations:

```python
web_agent = Agent(
    # ... existing configuration ...
    instructions=[
        "Always include sources",
        "Focus on recent market developments",  # Add custom instruction
        "Prioritize reliable financial sources"
    ],
)
```

### Modifying YFinance Tools

```python
finance_agent = Agent(
    # ... existing configuration ...
    tools=[YFinanceTools(
        stock_price=True,
        analyst_recommendations=True,
        company_info=True,
        historical_data=True,  # Add historical data
        financial_statements=True,  # Add financial statements

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Decommissioned Error**:
   ```bash
   ERROR: The model `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` has been decommissioned
   ```
   **Solution**: The script now uses `moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct` which is currently supported.

2. **ModuleNotFoundError**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **API Key Errors**:
   - Check your `.env` file exists in the project root
   - Verify your API keys are correct
   - Ensure no extra spaces in the keys
   - Test keys individually with simple API calls

4. **Environment File Not Found**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure .env is in the parent directory
   cd .. # Go to project root
   ls -la .env # Check if file exists
   ```

5. **Permission Errors**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x financial_analysis_team.py
   ```

6. **YFinance Data Errors**:
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify stock symbols are correct
   - Some data may be delayed or unavailable

### Debug Mode

Add debug information by modifying the script:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
